# Hermes Bridge API

A lightweight **REST + SSE bridge** that exposes [Hermes Agent](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com) to mobile apps and any HTTP client. Built for the [Agentfy](https://github.com/jcnh74/agentfy_app) iOS app, but provider-agnostic — it's plain HTTP, no WebSocket or custom handshake required.

The bridge runs alongside a Hermes installation, discovers the agents and skills configured under `~/.hermes/`, and streams agent responses over Server-Sent Events.

---

## Features

- **Chat with any Hermes agent** over HTTP, with token-by-token streaming via SSE
- **Multi-agent** — list, create, and edit agents; each gets isolated sessions
- **Skill management** — browse the `~/.hermes/skills/` catalog and attach/detach skills per agent
- **Model routing** — list available models, switch an agent's model on the fly
- **Provider key management** — read/write API keys in `~/.hermes/.env` so mobile clients never hold secrets
- **TTS proxy** — ElevenLabs / OpenAI text-to-speech and transcription routed server-side
- **Session persistence** — message history stored in the Hermes SQLite DB, importable/exportable
- **Device pairing** — QR-code pairing flow for connecting the Agentfy app

---

## Requirements

- Python **3.11+** (the same interpreter that runs your Hermes install)
- A working [Hermes Agent](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com) install at `~/.hermes/hermes-agent` (the bridge imports it at runtime and reads config from `~/.hermes/`)

---

## Install (one command)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jcnh74/hermes-bridge.git
cd hermes-bridge
./install.sh
```

The installer:
1. Finds your Hermes install (or honors `HERMES_AGENT_ROOT=/path`)
2. Picks the **same Python venv** that runs Hermes (so imports resolve)
3. Installs the bridge + optional QR support
4. Runs a preflight check and prints exactly how to start

If anything's off, it tells you precisely what to fix — no stack traces.

### Verify the environment anytime

```bash
hermes-bridge doctor
```

```
✓ Hermes Agent found: /Users/you/.hermes/hermes-agent
✓ Hermes Python modules import cleanly
✓ Hermes config loaded (default model: claude-opus-4-8)
All checks passed. Start the bridge with: hermes-bridge start
```

### Start it

```bash
hermes-bridge start              # daemonized; runs preflight first
hermes-bridge start --foreground # run in the foreground for debugging
hermes-bridge status             # is it running?
hermes-bridge pair               # QR + URL to connect the Agentfy app
hermes-bridge stop
```

Verify it's up:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8765/api/v1/health
# {"status":"ok","version":"0.1.0","agents_available":5,"sessions_active":0, ...}
```

### Manual install (if you'd rather not use the script)

```bash
# Use the Python that runs Hermes
~/.hermes/hermes-agent/venv/bin/python -m pip install -e ".[qr]"
~/.hermes/hermes-agent/venv/bin/python -m hermes_bridge.cli doctor
```

### Pointing at a non-standard Hermes location

```bash
export HERMES_AGENT_ROOT=/opt/hermes-agent   # dir containing run_agent.py
hermes-bridge doctor
```

### CLI commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `hermes-bridge doctor` | Check the environment is ready (run this first) |
| `hermes-bridge start [--port 8765] [--host 0.0.0.0] [--foreground] [--skip-checks]` | Start the server (runs preflight unless `--skip-checks`) |
| `hermes-bridge stop` | Stop the running server |
| `hermes-bridge status` | Check whether the server is running |
| `hermes-bridge restart` | Restart the server |
| `hermes-bridge pair` | Print pairing URL + QR code for the Agentfy app |

> **Multiple instances:** PID files are port-specific (`~/.hermes/bridge-<port>.pid`),
> so you can run several bridges on different ports without their lifecycle
> commands (`stop`/`status`/`restart`) clobbering each other.

---

## Run with Docker

The bridge imports a Hermes install at runtime, so the container uses a
**bring-your-own-Hermes** model: the Hermes source and your `~/.hermes` data
home (config, `.env` keys, `hermes.db`) are **mounted at runtime** — never baked
into the image. No secrets ever land in an image layer.

```bash
# From the repo root, with Hermes installed at ~/.hermes/hermes-agent:
docker compose up -d        # build + start in background
docker compose logs -f      # follow logs (watch preflight pass)
docker compose down         # stop
```

The bridge is then reachable at `http://localhost:8765/api/v1`.

Point at a non-standard Hermes location with env vars:

```bash
HERMES_HOST_PATH=/opt/hermes-agent HERMES_HOME_PATH=/opt/hermes-data \
  docker compose up -d
```

How it works:
- **Hermes source** is mounted read-only at `/hermes` (`HERMES_AGENT_ROOT`).
- **Hermes data home** (`~/.hermes`) is mounted read-write at `/root/.hermes` so
  sessions/skills persist and keys are read from the same `.env` the CLI uses.
- A host virtualenv can't be reused in the Linux container, so the entrypoint
  installs Hermes' Python deps **once** into a named volume (`bridge-venv`) on
  first boot, then runs `hermes-bridge doctor` before starting.

---

## Testing

The suite covers the bridge's own logic — discovery, persistence, skill
scanning, model validation, and the port-specific PID fix — with **no live
Hermes install or running server required** (a fake Hermes root and temp DBs
are fabricated in fixtures).

```bash
# Use the Python that runs Hermes
pip install -e ".[test]"
pytest                # run the suite
pytest --cov          # with coverage report
```

Coverage focuses on the pure, testable modules:

| Module | Coverage |
|--------|----------|
| `models.py` | 100% |
| `hermes_env.py` | ~95% |
| `skills.py` | ~88% |
| `persistence.py` | ~81% |

`server.py` and `agent_proxy.py` need a live Hermes/uvicorn runtime and are
covered by integration smoke tests rather than the unit suite (they're omitted
from the coverage target in `pyproject.toml`).

## Connecting the Agentfy App

In Agentfy, add a bridge connection pointing at:

```
http://<hermes-host>:8765/api/v1
```

Or run `hermes-bridge pair` and scan the QR code. For remote access, put the bridge behind a tunnel (e.g. Cloudflare Tunnel) and point the app at the public HTTPS URL — the API path stays `/api/v1`.

Repo layout also includes:
  Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, docker/entrypoint.sh   containerized run
  tests/                                                 pytest suite (no live Hermes needed)
  install.sh                                             one-command host install
```

The bridge does not bundle Hermes — it locates an existing install at `~/.hermes/hermes-agent` and imports `run_agent` / `hermes_cli` at runtime. Keys and config are read from and written to the standard `~/.hermes/` locations so the bridge and the Hermes CLI stay in sync.

---

## Security Notes

- API keys live only in `~/.hermes/.env` on the host. The `/settings/keys` endpoints report status but never echo secret values.
- The bridge binds `0.0.0.0` by default for LAN access. **Do not expose it directly to the public internet** — front it with an authenticated tunnel or reverse proxy.
